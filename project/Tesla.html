            Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla's first funding round and became the company's chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] In January 2024, the Model Y became the best-selling BEV in history.[citation needed]

            Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. <br>Starting in July 2020, it has 
            been the world's most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. 
            company to be so, and has been so again since November 2024.[8] In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market,
             with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[9]
            Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny,<br> and journalistic criticism, stemming from 
            allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union a
            ctivities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines.
